# Simple neural net

\
The program **simple_nn.rs** feed binary numbers into a neural net with two hidden layers of 8 neurons each and train the network to output the correct decimal number using a 7-segment display.

\
In the note [Back propagtion](./latex/Back_propagation.pdf) the reader is walked through the theory of an ultra simple neural net in great detail.
\
The same ultra simple net is simulated with numbers in this [spread sheet](./Simple_Neural_Net.ods) 
\
\
The aim is to bridge the gab for absolute beginners, who knows simple calculus, but are new to machine learning.
\
\
Reading the note and playing with the spread sheet hopefully can help gain familiarity with simple neural nets.
