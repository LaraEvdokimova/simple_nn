# Simple neural net

\
The program **simple_nn.rs** feed binary numbers into a neural net with two hidden layers of 8 neurons each and train the network to output the correct decimal number using a 7-segment display.

\
The note [Back propagtion](./blob/master/latex/Back_propagation.pdf) walk through the theory of an ultra simple neural net in great detail. 
\
The aim is to bridge the gab for absolute beginners, who knows simple calculus, but are new to machine learning.
\
\
The ultra simple net is simulated in a [spread sheet](./Simple_Neural_Net.ods).
\
Playing with the spread sheet hopefully can help gain familiarity with simple neural nets.
